# EuroLeague Quiz

Web application for quizzes and knowledge games focused on **EuroLeague Basketball** (from 2000 onward).

## Project Structure

```
backend/   — Python/FastAPI API server, data ingestion, SQLAlchemy models
frontend/  — React (Vite) UI
scripts/   — Startup scripts (start-backend.bat, start-frontend.bat)
```

## Quick Start

Run the startup scripts from the project root:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — backend (creates venv, installs deps, runs migrations, starts server)
scripts\start-backend.bat

# Terminal 2 — frontend (installs npm deps, starts dev server)
scripts\start-frontend.bat
```

Then open `http://localhost:5173` to play.

## Games

- **TicTacToe** — Claim cells on a 3×3 board by naming players who match both row and column team criteria. Solo, local 1v1, and online modes. Opening `/tictactoe` lands on online **Quick Match** — a near-one-click, lichess-style pool grid — with Solo, Local 1v1, and Play-a-Friend one tap away.
- **Roster Guess** — Guess the full roster of a EuroLeague team from a specific season. Solo and multiplayer.
- **Higher or Lower** — Compare player stats and build a streak. Easy, medium, and hard tiers with leaderboards.
- **Career Quiz** — Guess the player from a professional club career timeline built from Wikipedia. EuroLeague data only selects which players are eligible; the displayed career follows Wikipedia alone. Solo practice and 2-player race modes.
- **Photo Quiz** — Guess the player from a headshot. Solo practice, 2-player online friend races, and public Quick Match races, drawn from players with a Wikipedia page and either a EuroLeague CDN or Wikipedia image.

## Backend

### Setup

```bash
cd backend
pip install -e .
alembic upgrade head
alembic -c alembic_auth.ini upgrade head
```

The backend uses two separate databases. `ELQ_DATABASE_URL` points at the
tracked EuroLeague content database (`backend/data/euroleague.db`), which ships
with deployments and may be overwritten. `ELQ_AUTH_DATABASE_URL` points at the
mutable user datastore and defaults locally to `sqlite:///data/users.db`; set it
to an absolute durable path such as `sqlite:////home/data/users.db` on Azure App
Service. A later managed Postgres cutover can use a driver-qualified URL such
as `postgresql+psycopg://...`. Local `backend/data/users.db*` files are
gitignored and must not be committed.

Clerk-backed account auth is configured with `ELQ_CLERK_ISSUER` and
`ELQ_CLERK_JWKS_URL` so the backend can verify `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
session JWTs against Clerk's cached JWKS. `ELQ_CLERK_SECRET_KEY` is reserved for
Clerk Backend API operations, `ELQ_CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` verifies Clerk/Svix
webhooks, and `ELQ_CLERK_AUTHORIZED_PARTIES` can restrict accepted token `azp`
values. Unknown JWT `kid` refreshes are per-key cached and globally throttled
by `ELQ_CLERK_JWKS_UNKNOWN_KID_MIN_REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECONDS` to avoid JWKS fetch
amplification while still recovering from Clerk key rotation. JWKS fetch/parse
failures surface as service errors rather than anonymous fallback.
`GET /auth/me` requires a valid token and JIT-provisions a local user in the
auth datastore; existing gameplay endpoints remain open to anonymous callers.

Signed-in clients can call `POST /auth/link-guest` with the current opaque
`guest_id` from `frontend/src/identity.js` to claim pre-login guest activity for
future account-owned features. The backend strips and clamps the id to 64
characters, inserts a `user_guest_ids` row, and treats relinking by the same
user as an idempotent no-op. The conflict rule is **first-wins**: once any user
has linked a `guest_id`, a different user receives `409 Conflict` and the
existing link is not moved. This link is additive only; game serializers and
anonymous gameplay remain unchanged.

### Production auth deployment

Azure App Service should keep mutable account data outside the zip-deployed app
directory. Set `ELQ_AUTH_DATABASE_URL=sqlite:////home/data/users.db` and keep
`WEBSITES_ENABLE_APP_SERVICE_STORAGE=true` (or the default enabled setting) so
the `/home` mount survives restarts and deployments. Paths outside `/home` are
ephemeral on App Service Linux; the tracked content database can be redeployed,
but `users.db` must not be committed or shipped.

The backend artifact includes `backend/startup.sh`. Configure the App Service
startup command as `sh startup.sh`; it runs `pip install .`, creates SQLite
parent directories, applies both Alembic heads (`alembic upgrade head` and
`alembic -c alembic_auth.ini upgrade head`), and starts Uvicorn on Azure's
`PORT`. Running SQLite migrations at startup assumes a single App Service
instance. JWT verification is stateless, but the SQLite auth DB is the
single-instance limit; a future scale-out cutover should point
`ELQ_AUTH_DATABASE_URL` at managed Postgres, for example
`postgresql+psycopg://...`.

Set backend auth values only through App Service application settings:
`ELQ_CLERK_SECRET_KEY`, `ELQ_CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `ELQ_CLERK_ISSUER`,
`ELQ_CLERK_JWKS_URL`, optional `ELQ_CLERK_AUTHORIZED_PARTIES`, plus
`ELQ_CORS_ORIGINS` for the Static Web App origin. The frontend deploy workflow
injects `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` from a GitHub secret at build time; leaving
it unset intentionally ships a fully anonymous build. Before enabling production
sign-in, configure the Clerk Dashboard for required unique usernames, session
token claims, passkeys, and the OAuth applications for Google, Apple, and
Microsoft. See [`docs/clerk-auth.md`](docs/clerk-auth.md) and
[`docs/azure-deploy.md`](docs/azure-deploy.md).

### Run API Server

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Run Data Ingestion

```bash
cd backend
python -m ingestion.ingest --start-season 2000 --end-season 2025
```

### Run Wikipedia Career Ingestion

Career Quiz uses cached Wikipedia career-history data; gameplay does not call Wikipedia live. EuroLeague data is used only to choose which players to look up — the cached career timeline comes purely from each player's Wikipedia infobox career history (no roster merging).

```bash
cd backend
python -m ingestion.wikipedia_careers --limit 500 --report data/wikipedia-career-report.json --candidates-report data/wikipedia-career-candidates.json
```

Reviewed page/team overrides live in `backend/ingestion/wikipedia_overrides.json`. The default candidate set is 500 players: 450 recent/top EuroLeague game-count players plus 50 early-era roster-heavy players from 2000–2006. The ingestion command fails the feature-enablement threshold when fewer than 200 eligible players are available. After running this ingestion or any migration locally, upload `backend/data/euroleague.db` to Azure before deploying.

### Run Wikipedia Photo Ingestion

Photo Quiz uses cached Wikipedia infobox images for players who have a Wikipedia page but no EuroLeague CDN headshot. The image ingestion command inspects unchecked `players.wikipedia_url` rows, stores a resolved Wikimedia image URL in `wikipedia_image_url` when the basketball infobox has an image, and always sets `wikipedia_image_checked_at` for successful inspections so normal re-runs skip already checked players.

```bash
cd backend
python -m ingestion.wikipedia_images --report data/wikipedia-image-report.json
```

### API Docs

Once the server is running, visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` for the interactive API documentation.

### Architecture Notes

User account data lives in a dedicated auth datastore with its own SQLAlchemy
engine/session/Base (`backend/app/auth_database.py`) and its own Alembic
environment (`backend/alembic_auth/`, run with `alembic -c alembic_auth.ini`).
The auth schema is kept portable for a later managed Postgres move: UUIDs are
stored as strings, timestamps are normalized to UTC-aware datetimes in the
application layer, and migrations avoid SQLite-only types or PRAGMAs.

The backend acts as a Clerk resource server for authenticated requests. Auth
dependencies under `backend/app/auth/` verify Clerk session JWTs with a cached
JWKS, map the Clerk `sub` to `users.clerk_user_id`, JIT-provision missing local
users, and expose required (`get_current_user`) and additive
(`get_optional_user`) FastAPI dependencies. Invalid or absent tokens never gate
anonymous gameplay unless an endpoint explicitly opts into required auth.
`POST /auth/link-guest` is one such required-auth endpoint; it records
`guest_id` ownership in `user_guest_ids` for future ratings/history attribution,
using a first-wins unique `guest_id` rule and delete-orphan cascade from
`users`.

Mutating quiz operations use a **Game action** seam in `backend/app/game_actions.py`.
Routers, WebSocket handlers, and timer jobs run game actions through this helper so the
application layer owns commit/rollback and game modules stay HTTP-agnostic.

Online TicTacToe, Roster Guess, Career Quiz, and Photo Quiz share an **Online Game Realtime Module**. The backend
Module in `backend/app/services/realtime.py` owns WebSocket connection cleanup,
broadcast envelopes, server-side turn timers for timer-enabled games, disconnect-grace timers,
timer expiry, targeted broadcasts, and schema-compliant error/result messages. Game-specific
Adapters in `backend/app/services/realtime_adapters.py` map TicTacToe, Roster Guess, Career
Quiz, and Photo Quiz rules into that shared Interface. TicTacToe online disconnects use a configurable
`ELQ_ONLINE_DISCONNECT_GRACE_SECONDS` window before broadcasting a terminal `opponent_left`
forfeit; explicit online resign broadcasts a terminal `resigned` result immediately.

Career Quiz adds a **Wikipedia Career Ingestion Module** under `backend/ingestion/`.
It resolves local EuroLeague players to English Wikipedia pages, parses basketball
infobox career-history rows, resolves team labels to stable keys, merges local EuroLeague
roster stints as validation/fill data, stores cached Career Timelines, and records a
Career Data Revision. Solo Career Quiz rounds use signed Solo Round Tokens so the answer
is not stored in browser state or persisted as a solo game row.
Player image/link data lives directly on `players`: EuroLeague CDN headshots are stored in
`euroleague_image_url`, Wikipedia page URLs in `wikipedia_url`, and Wikipedia infobox photo
enrichment in `wikipedia_image_url` / `wikipedia_image_checked_at`. Existing game payloads
continue to expose the frontend-compatible `image_url` JSON key for the EuroLeague image.
Photo Quiz uses those same columns for its eligible pool and resolves images CDN-first:
`euroleague_image_url` wins when present, otherwise `wikipedia_image_url` is used. Solo
Photo Quiz rounds use signed Solo Round Tokens and expose only the resolved clue image until
the answer is guessed correctly or revealed. Online Photo Quiz friend games use
`POST /quiz/photo/games`, `/games/join`, `/games/{id}/guess`, `/no-answer-offer`,
`/no-answer-response`, `GET /quiz/photo/games/{id}`, and `WS /quiz/photo/ws/{id}`;
the round clue is the resolved `image_url`. Public Photo Quiz Quick Match uses
`POST /quiz/photo/quick-match`, `POST /quiz/photo/quick-match/cancel`, and
`GET /quiz/photo/quick-match/pools` with `quick` / `standard` / `long` presets
that set first-to-1 / first-to-3 / first-to-5, keep wrong guesses private, and
server-skip idle public rounds after the per-round timeout.
Multiplayer Career Quiz and Photo Quiz resolved-round state includes
`latest_completed_round.next_round_starts_at` during the three-second reveal lock; the
backend rejects next-round guesses with `round_locked` until that UTC timestamp elapses.
Multiplayer Career Quiz and Photo Quiz guess and no-answer mutations must include the client-visible
`round_number`; Photo Quiz no-answer responses must also echo the current
`pending_no_answer_offer_version` from state so replayed responses cannot resolve a later offer.
Stale actions are rejected with `round_stale` or a conflict so the frontend can resync
without applying old input to the current round. Career Quiz and Photo Quiz multiplayer use WebSocket
push as their primary sync path, while plain `GET /quiz/{career|photo}/games/{id}` remains the
refresh and fallback-sync Interface.

The frontend mirrors that Interface with `frontend/src/realtimeSchema.js` and
`frontend/src/useOnlineGameRealtime.js`, so reconnect, background state sync,
waiting-for-opponent polling, cleanup, and action dispatch stay out of the game boards.
TicTacToe Quick Match setup screens can poll
`GET /quiz/tictactoe/quick-match/pools` every 5 seconds for per-preset
`searching` and `in_progress` presence counts derived from public pool rows.
Photo Quiz exposes the same presence shape at `GET /quiz/photo/quick-match/pools`,
counting only public Photo Quiz searches and active public matches.

Mutating TicTacToe, Roster Guess, Career Quiz, and Photo Quiz HTTP endpoints now use the same realtime
message envelopes as WebSocket broadcasts: successful actions return
`{ "type": "state", "payload": { "game": ..., "result": ..., "completed_round": ..., "terminal": ... } }`
and Game action errors return `{ "type": "error", "payload": { "code": ..., "message": ... } }`
with the corresponding HTTP status. Read-only `GET /games/{id}` endpoints still
return plain game state for polling and refresh hydration.

Online `create`/`join` requests for TicTacToe, Roster Guess, Career Quiz, and Photo Quiz accept an
optional `guest_id`. The backend treats it as an opaque, untrusted token: services clamp it
to 64 characters (`None` when blank) and persist it on the player slot
(`player1_guest_id` / `player2_guest_id`) without ever serializing it into shared game
state. The field is never required, so anonymous play keeps working when no `guest_id` is
sent.

## Frontend

### Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Run Dev Server

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Opens at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Shared Pre-Game Setup UX

Every game's pre-game screen is built from three shared building blocks in `frontend/src/`:

- `GameSetupShell.jsx` — common chrome (Home logo, per-game accent header, canonical
  card, error slot, optional second card such as the Higher or Lower leaderboard).
- `GameModeSelector.jsx` — the controlled Solo / Local 1v1 / Online mode cards. Selecting
  **Online** reveals a slim **Create / Join** sub-toggle, so joining a friend's game lives
  inside the same screen instead of a separate "join game" page. It renders nothing for
  single-mode games (Higher or Lower).
- `WaitingLobby.jsx` — the shared "waiting for opponent" screen (join code with
  copy-to-clipboard, auto-start helper text, and Cancel) used by every online board.
  For TicTacToe it also renders a copyable **shareable invite link**
  (`${origin}/tictactoe?join=ABC123`); opening that link lands on TicTacToe setup with
  the code prefilled in Online → Join, so the invitee only adds a name and joins. The
  link helpers live in `frontend/src/inviteLink.js` (`buildInviteUrl` / `parseJoinCode`).

`GameSetup.jsx` (TicTacToe), `RosterGuessSetup.jsx`, `CareerQuizSetup.jsx`,
`PhotoQuizSetup.jsx`, and `HigherLowerSetup.jsx` compose these, mapping the canonical UI
keys (`solo` / `local` / `online`, sub `create` / `join`) onto their own backend modes.

### TicTacToe Quick Match: default landing + one-click pooling

Opening `/tictactoe` lands directly on **Online → Quick Match**, so the matchmaking pool
grid is the first thing players see (Solo, Local 1v1, and Play-a-Friend stay one tap away
via `GameModeSelector`; a valid `?join=` invite still lands on Online → Play a Friend →
Join with the code prefilled). The flow is near one-click — there is **no separate "Find
Match" button**. Tapping a pool card *is* the action: it immediately enters that pool and
the board switches to the searching lobby. Standard (Best of 3 · 40s) is highlighted as the
default. There is no name gate — the optional name field prefills with the saved nickname or
a stable auto-generated guest name, and clearing it falls back to anonymous play. While a
pick is in flight every pool card (and the mode controls) freeze, so a fast multi-tap can't
open several waiting games for the same guest. The home TicTacToe card also carries a
visible **Quick Match** call-to-action that jumps straight into the same default.

These pieces are built game-agnostic so other games can adopt Quick Match by mirroring the
shared-component pattern:

- `QuickMatchPanel.jsx` — the reusable one-click pool grid. Props: `presets`, live `pools`
  presence, `onPick(presetKey)`, `disabled`, `pendingPreset`, `defaultPreset`, `label`, and
  an optional `formatPresence`. It carries no game specifics.
- `QuickMatchSearchingLobby.jsx` — the generalized "searching the pool…" lobby. `usePools`,
  `getPresetLabel`, and `title` are props (defaulting to the TicTacToe pool source/copy), so
  Photo Quiz already reuses it with its own pool feed and labels.
- `HomeQuickMatchCta.jsx` — the reusable home-card CTA `<Link>` (pass the setup route in
  `to`); it sits beside a card's main link without nesting anchors.
- `identity.js` `getGuestName()` / `getDisplayName()` — the guest-name fallback (see Guest
  Identity below).

**Extension checklist** — a new game adopts Quick Match by adding: (1) a backend
`MatchmakingAdapter` + presets (the matchmaking engine is already generic); (2) a frontend
presets array plus a pools hook built from `useQuickMatchPoolsFrom(enabled, fetchPools)`;
(3) wiring its setup screen to `QuickMatchPanel` (one-click) and its board to
`QuickMatchSearchingLobby`; and (4) a `HomeQuickMatchCta` on its home card. No new
shared-component code is required.

### Guest Identity

`frontend/src/identity.js` is the single source of a lightweight, persistent guest
identity used by online matchmaking:

- `getGuestId()` returns a stable opaque id generated once via `crypto.randomUUID()`
  (with a fallback) and cached in `localStorage` under `elq_guest_id`. A blank or
  oversized stored value is regenerated. All storage access is `try/catch`-safe, so
  identity degrades to anonymous play when storage is unavailable.
- `getNickname()` / `setNickname()` persist the shared display name under `elq_nickname`
  (clamped to `NICKNAME_MAX_LENGTH = 30`, the Higher or Lower backend limit), migrating
  the legacy `hol_nickname` key on first read.
- `getGuestName()` returns a stable, auto-generated guest name (e.g. `Guest 4821`) persisted
  under `elq_guest_name` (separate from `elq_nickname`, so it never overwrites a deliberate
  nickname) with a page-lifetime memory fallback like `getGuestId()`. `getDisplayName()`
  returns the saved nickname when set, otherwise that guest name — this is what the
  near-one-click TicTacToe Quick Match prefills so online play needs no name gate.

Every setup screen prefills its name field from `getNickname()` (TicTacToe Quick Match uses
`getDisplayName()` so the field is never empty) and persists edits via `setNickname()`; the
shared nickname is not overwritten while a screen is in Local 1v1 mode (where "Player 1" is
a placeholder rather than the user's name). Clearing the field still sends no name, so
anonymous play keeps working. `frontend/src/api.js` attaches `guest_id` to TicTacToe, Roster
Guess, Career Quiz, and Photo Quiz online `create`/`join` requests; the nickname rides the
existing `player1_name` / `player_name` field.

### Account Auth (Clerk, frontend)

Sign-in is **purely additive** and built on Clerk's prebuilt components, so anonymous play
keeps working with zero friction. The integration is isolated to a few modules:

- `frontend/src/auth.jsx` is the **only** module that imports `@clerk/clerk-react`. It exposes
  `AuthProvider` (wraps the app in `<ClerkProvider>` when `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` is set,
  otherwise renders children unchanged; when enabled it also wires Clerk's `routerPush`/
  `routerReplace` to react-router so path-routed surfaces navigate the SPA softly), `AuthMenu`
  (a fixed header control showing Sign in / Sign up when signed out and `<UserButton/>` with a
  custom **Profile** menu link when signed in), `ProfileRoute` (the `/profile/*` page — see
  below), and a future-use `RequireAuth` stub for protected routes. When the publishable key is
  missing the whole thing is inert: no provider mounts, no token is issued, `AuthMenu` renders
  nothing, `ProfileRoute` redirects home, and a one-line dev `console.info` notes sign-in is off.
- `frontend/src/authToken.js` is a tiny, framework-free token registry
  (`setAuthTokenProvider` / `clearAuthTokenProvider` / `getAuthToken`). It decouples `api.js`
  from Clerk: `api.js` simply `await getAuthToken()` in `request()` and adds an
  `Authorization: Bearer …` header **only when a token is present**. The Clerk bridge registers
  a provider only while signed in and the effect cleanup clears it on sign-out, so signed-out
  REST calls structurally cannot attach a token. `getAuthToken()` also races the provider
  against a timeout and swallows errors to `null`, so token trouble never breaks a request.
- `frontend/src/identityBridge.js` bridges Clerk into a neutral `AuthContext` (default
  "signed out", so setup screens and unit tests render with no provider). `resolveDisplayName`
  is the pure precedence rule — Clerk `username` → `fullName` → `firstName`, clamped to
  `NICKNAME_MAX_LENGTH`, never the email address — falling back to the guest value.
  `useClerkPrefilledName(getFallback)` is the hook every setup screen uses for its name field:
  it seeds from the guest fallback, upgrades to the Clerk name once it loads (via the
  "adjust state while rendering" pattern, no effect), and never clobbers a value the user has
  typed — so the Local 1v1 "Player 1" placeholder and manual edits are preserved.
- After sign-in the bridge makes a **best-effort** `POST /auth/link-guest` (with the Bearer
  token and the current `getGuestId()`), once per `(user, guest)` pair. It fetches the token
  first and bails if absent, only marks the pair linked on success (so a transient failure
  retries on a later mount), and swallows all failures so a missing or briefly-unavailable
  endpoint never blocks sign-in.

- The **profile view** lives at the `/profile/*` route (`ProfileRoute` in `auth.jsx`, lazily
  imported by `App.jsx` so `App` stays Clerk-free). It renders Clerk's prebuilt `<UserProfile/>`
  (path-routed) inside the app chrome, surfacing username, email, display name, and avatar, and is
  reachable from the `<UserButton/>` menu's **Profile** link. Signed-out visitors and key-less
  builds are redirected home, so deep links never strand anyone on an empty page.
- **Required unique username:** new sign-ups (email **and** social) must set a unique username —
  this is a Clerk Dashboard setting, and a session-token claim makes the backend mirror it onto the
  local `User` on first provision. The signed-in username then flows into every setup screen's name
  field via `useClerkPrefilledName`. See [`docs/clerk-auth.md`](docs/clerk-auth.md) for the exact
  dashboard steps.

Set `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` in `frontend/.env.development` for local sign-in or as the
GitHub Actions secret consumed by `deploy.yml`; leave it blank for fully anonymous builds.


## Testing

### Backend (pytest)

```bash
cd backend
pytest                              # all tests (excludes smoke)
pytest tests/test_api.py            # API tests only
pytest tests/test_tictactoe_api.py  # TicTacToe tests only
pytest tests/test_higher_lower.py   # Higher or Lower tests only
pytest tests/test_career_quiz.py    # Career Quiz tests only
pytest tests/test_photo_quiz.py     # Photo Quiz tests only
```

### Frontend Unit Tests (Vitest + React Testing Library)

```bash
cd frontend
npm test            # run once
npm run test:watch  # watch mode
```

### Frontend E2E Tests (Playwright)

```bash
cd frontend
npm run test:e2e
```

Playwright auto-starts both backend and frontend. Requires the backend venv to exist (`backend/.venv`).

### Smoke Tests (post-deploy)

```bash
cd backend
pytest tests/smoke/ --base-url https://euroleague-quiz-backend-app.azurewebsites.net
```

## CI/CD

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment:

1. **PR to `main`** → `ci.yml` runs: backend tests, frontend unit tests, build check, E2E tests. All must pass before merging.
2. **Merge to `main`** → `deploy.yml` runs: tests again as a gate → deploys backend to Azure App Service + frontend to Azure Static Web Apps → App Service startup applies content/auth migrations → post-deploy smoke tests verify the live API.

**Do not push directly to `main`.** Always use a pull request so CI checks run first.
